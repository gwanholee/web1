  <p>Hi I'm Gwanho. I'm 23 years old and just finished my military service. I served as an sergeant assistant and believe that I became much better both mentally and physically. Now that my service is over, I plan to study and prepare for my future. 20 months of service was a l ot and I don't really remember what I studied before my service, but definitely <strong>believe that my experience will help me reach back to the level that I've once achieved and <u>even further</u></strong>.<img src="life.jpg" width="85%"></p><p style="margin-top:60px;">I've been thinking of how I should live my life since I was 12. I've seen many people and talked to many people, but only came to the conclusion that there is no answer to it. No matter what you do, life goes on and all you can do is to try to make the best choice when the opportunity is given.</p>
